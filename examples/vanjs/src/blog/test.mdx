# Hello World

Introducing **MDZ** a Markdown preprocessor designed for [Zikojs](https://github.com/zakarialaoui10)
Thanks to the [interleaving](https://github.com/vanjs-org/van/issues/456) capability between **Zikojs** and **VanJS**, MDZ is fully compatible with VanJS as well.

The example below show how it works.

To define a component, you can use a Hyperscript-based syntax : 
```js
// compoenents/Counter.js
import van from "vanjs-core";

const Counter = ({start = 0}={}) => {
  const { button } = van.tags;
  const counter = van.state(start);
  return (
    button({ onclick: () => ++counter.val }, "Counter: ", counter)
  );
};
export default Counter;

```

To integrate the component inside MDZ, use JSX-like syntax :

```jsx
<Counter start={5} />
```

The MDZ file is parsed as a JavaScript module and returns the UI component as its default export.
Additionally, any declared attributes are exposed as named exports

```js
import Blog ,{title} from "./blog/test.mdx";
console.log(title) // Vanjs Zikojs Interleaving
```
In this case, Blog behaves like a JavaScript function with destructured props : (\{ counter_start = 0 } = \{}) 

this design allows you to pass props to any part of the Markdown content â€” including passing them as props to embedded VanJS components.

<Counter start={counter_start} />


## P5-wrapper Example :

First of all [P5.wrapper](https://github.com/zakarialaoui10/p5.wrapper) is another Zikojs and VanJS plugin that enables P5.js to run in a declarative and component-based way.
It's not ready for production yet, but I've included this demo to showcase how it works.

## Show Supports

If you find this project useful or inspiring, consider showing your support by giving a star to the libraries that make it all possible : 
- => [Zikojs](https://github.com/zakarialaoui10/ziko.js) The core UI engine that powers reactive rendering in this project.
- => [Mdzjs](https://github.com/zakarialaoui10/mdzjs) The Markdown preprocessor that lets you use JSX-like components and JavaScript expressions inside Markdown files.
- => [Vanjs](https://github.com/vanjs-org/van) A lightweight UI library compatible with Zikojs, used here for interleaving component rendering.
- => [Ziko-Wrapper](https://github.com/zakarialaoui10/ziko-wrapper) The bridge that enables using Zikojs components inside Vanjs seamlessly without compatibility issues.
- => [p5.wrapper](https://github.com/zakarialaoui10/p5.wrapper) A declarative wrapper that allows embedding P5.js sketches as components inside your app.
