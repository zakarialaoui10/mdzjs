**MDZ** (Markdown for ***zikojs***) is a format that allows you to append Zikojs Elements directly within Markdown.

It combines the simplicity of Markdown syntax with the power and flexibility of ***Javascript***

Hereâ€™s an example of an interactive block rendered within this MDZ file:

<InteractiveBlock data="Hello  from MDZ" color="cyan"/>

### Features of MDZ:
1- **Simple Integration :** Write Markdown as usual, and inject ZikoJS elements wherever needed.
2- **Frontmatter Support :** In this example, the title of the document is set dynamically through the frontmatter.

3- **Extensible :** Create custom components like InteractiveBlock and use them in any Markdown file.
